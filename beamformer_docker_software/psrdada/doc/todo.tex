\chapter{APSR Objectives}
\label{app:dada_todo}

APSR will depend upon the following new techniques, which must be
implemented, demonstrated, and rigorously tested.

\begin{itemize}

\item streaming UDP packets from board to nodes

\item optimal use of multiple cores

\item processing directly from RAM 

\item simultaneously processing and writing to disk

\item processing data written to disk \\

\end{itemize}

\noindent
In addition, the following management software must be written/adapted:

\begin{itemize}

\item Data reduction control: scheduling and logging

\item User Interfaces: text, gui, web-based?

\item TCS Interface

\item Collection, presentation, and archival of reduced data

\end{itemize}
\section{Streaming UDP packets from board to nodes}

Can it be done while processing? How should dropped packets be handled? \\
{\bf Who:} Grant and Willem \\
{\bf Status:} hardware ready, no software

\section{Optimal use of multiple cores}

Is a multi-threaded solution the most efficient? \\
{\bf Who:} Willem \\
{\bf Status:} implemented but not optimized, currently debugging

\section{Processing directly from RAM}

Should multiple threads be triggered to return results before reaching
end-of-data, or should end-of-data be induced at regular intervals? \\
{\bf Who:} Willem \\
{\bf Status:} implemented, tested on single archive only

\section{Simultaneously processing and writing to disk}

Should a monitor be used to schedule the two tasks intelligently, or
should priorities be assigned to the processes? \\
{\bf Who:} Willem {\it and Andrew?} \\
{\bf Status:} requires redesign of ring buffer

\section{Processing data written to disk}

Can the redistribution and processing of data written to disk take
place during easy observations, or only offline?  How should different
data sets be scheduled?  \\
{\bf Who:} Willem {\it and Andrew?} \\
{\bf Status:} simple plan: process easiest (lowest DM) observations first
