\chapter{Primary Read Client Main Loop}
\label{app:dada_prc_main}

In this chapter, the Primary Read Client Main Loop API is specified in
detail.  The Primary Read Client (PRC) Main Loop implements the PRC
Data Flow Control.  The PRC Main Loop is implemented as a function,
{\tt dada\_prc\_main}, which receives a pointer to a struct, {\tt
dada\_prc\_main\_t}, as its only argument.  The member variables of
this struct must be properly set up before the Main Loop is entered,
as described in the following section.

\section{Initialization}

The Primary Read Client Main Loop structure is created as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
#include "dada_prc_main.h"
dada_prc_main_t* prcm = dada_prc_main_create ();
\end{verbatim}
After creation, the following member variables must be initialized:
\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf {\tt log}} pointer to the {\tt multilog\_t} struct
	that will be used for status and error reporting

\item {\bf {\tt data\_block}} pointer to the {\tt ipcio\_t} struct 
	that is connected to the Data Block

\item {\bf {\tt header\_block}} pointer to the {\tt ipcio\_t} struct
	that is connected to the Header Block

\item {\bf {\tt open\_function}} pointer to the function that opens
	the file descriptor to which data will be written:
\begin{verbatim}
int open_function (dada_prc_main_t*);
\end{verbatim}
  This function should initialize the following member
  variables of {\tt dada\_prc\_main\_t}:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf {\tt fd}} file descriptor to which data will be written
\item {\bf {\tt transfer\_bytes}} total number of bytes to write
\item {\bf {\tt optimal\_bytes}} optimal number of bytes to write each time
\item {\bf {\tt header}} [optional] header to be written to the file descriptor
\end{itemize}
  The {\tt header} member variable will be initialized before calling
  {\tt open\_function} and will be written to the file descriptor
  after this function returns. This function should return a value
  less than zero in the case of any error.
\newpage
\item {\bf {\tt close\_function}} pointer to the function that closes
	the file descriptor after data has been written:
\begin{verbatim}
int close_function (dada_prc_main_t*, uint64_t bytes_written);
\end{verbatim}
  The {\tt bytes\_written} argument specifies the total number of bytes
  successfully written to the file descriptor.  This function should
  perform any tasks required to close the file descriptor and return a
  value less than zero in the case of any error.

\item {\bf {\tt context}} [optional] pointer to any additional information.
  Should the implementation of any of the above functions
  require access to other information, a pointer to this information
  can be stored in the {\tt context} member variable and retrieved by
  casting this member inside the function.

\end{enumerate}
